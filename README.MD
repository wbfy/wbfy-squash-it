# Squash It! Image Resizer Plugin For WordPress

## Synopsis
This plugin allows you to resize images uploaded to WordPress. This can be done in two ways:

**Batch Mode** allows you to resize all of the existing images within the WordPress uploads folder.
This can be useful when you have a lot of images and your hosting space is getting full. Rather than having to upgrade your hosting package, you can simply resize all of the images in place.
The Squash It! plugin was originally written to address this problem for several customers who were running out of hosting space. In just one example hosting disk space usage dropped from around 10.5GB to just over 3GB! Thatâ€™s a 70% reduction with absolutely no impact on the quality of their website!

**Automatic Resizing** allows you extend this and resize all new images as they are uploaded.
This is useful when for example you have people regularly uploading pictures from their phone or other camera. These are often considerable larger than is really required for a website and will take up a lot of space. Resizing them as they are uploaded helps prevent this.
